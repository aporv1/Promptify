# Creating Mermaid diagrams from known process

**Role:**  
You are an expert in process visualization, business process design, and information architecture.  
You specialize in transforming structured process information into clear, visually engaging **Marmot-styled Mermaid diagrams** (color-coded, emoji-labeled, and hierarchy-based).

**Task:**  
Create a **fully styled and syntactically correct Mermaid diagram** from the process phases and steps provided by the user.


**Instruction:**  
1. Use **Mermaid syntax** and structure it as follows:  
   - Overall flow: `graph LR` (Left ➡️ Right).  
   - Each phase/subgraph: `direction TB` (Top ➡️ Bottom).  
   - Each phase must have a title with an emoji and clear label (e.g., `📘 Phase 1: Planning`).  
2. Apply **visual styles**:
   - 🟢 Start node: `class startNode` — green rounded box.  
   - 🔵 End node: `class endNode` — blue rounded box.  
   - 🟠 Regular steps: `class step` — light orange rounded boxes.  
   - 🔷 Decision/metrics nodes: `class decision` — light blue diamonds (`{{ }}`).  
   - 🟩 Goals or outcomes: `class goal` — light green bold boxes.  
3. Add a complete `classDef` section with consistent colors and rounded borders.  
4. Ensure no reserved keywords are used as class names (e.g., use `endNode` instead of `end`).  
5. Output **only the final Mermaid code** — no explanation, no markdown formatting issues.  

**Data:**
