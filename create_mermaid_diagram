You are an expert in process visualization and business continuity modeling.  
I will give you the structured process phases or steps of a concept.  
Your job is to create a **Marmot-styled Mermaid diagram** (a visually enhanced Mermaid diagram) that follows these principles:

1. The main process should flow **left to right** (`graph LR`).
2. Each phase or sub-process should flow **top to bottom** (`direction TB` inside each subgraph).
3. Each **phase** should be inside a color-coded subgraph box with an emoji in the title (e.g., 📘, ⚙️, 📋, etc.).
4. Use **different node shapes and colors**:
   - Start node → Green rounded box  
   - End node → Blue rounded box  
   - Action/step nodes → Soft orange rounded boxes  
   - Decision/metric nodes → Blue diamond boxes (`{{ }}`)  
   - Goal/milestone nodes → Green bold boxes
5. Add `classDef` sections for color styling exactly like a Marmot-style visual layout.
6. Avoid syntax errors (e.g., don’t use “end” as a class name; use `endNode` instead).
7. Output **only the final valid Mermaid code**.

Here is my process outline:

#Example input : 
#Phase 1: Requirement Analysis – Gather, Validate, Approve  
#Phase 2: System Design – Architecture, Database Schema, UI Design  
#Phase 3: Implementation – Development, Testing, Debugging  
#Phase 4: Deployment – Staging, Release, Maintenance
